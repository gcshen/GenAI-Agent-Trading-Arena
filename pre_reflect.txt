Investment strategy for the day: Diversify across sectors by capping any single-stock position at 8% of portfolio and any sector at 30%, maintain a 10% cash reserve for opportunistic bids, use volatility-adjusted position sizing (smaller allocations for higher volatility), enforce automated stop-losses around 8% (or ~1.5×ATR) with trailing stops and partial profit-taking at ~10% and larger trims near 20%, rebalance every few iterations or immediately when the market index breaches short-term thresholds, and promptly reduce concentration if exposure limits are exceeded to control portfolio volatility.

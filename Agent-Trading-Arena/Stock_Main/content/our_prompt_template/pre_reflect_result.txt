Weakness: The latest 8%-per-stock cap and active rules are not being fully enforced and have produced opportunity/implementation costs. Evidence: Stock B is $5,235.34 which equals ~10.03% of total wealth (5,235.34 / 52,208.94), violating the 8% cap; cash deployment from Day 2 to Day 3 fell by $7,487.22 (46,221.81 -> 38,734.59) to buy positions but portfolio value rose only $1,631.72 (7,661.54 -> 9,293.26) while total wealth actually declined by $878.64 (53,087.58 -> 52,208.94), indicating poor net execution or mistimed trades. The strategy calls for ~10% cash reserve but current cash is ~74.2% of wealth (38,734.59 / 52,208.94), an overconservative stance that reduces return potential. Also stop-loss/trailing-stop and partial profit rules haven’t produced realized gains (A only ~1% gain, B ~0%), implying rules either were not triggered or not applied. Strength: The strategy’s diversification and volatility-aware approach is visible and has limited drawdown risk. Evidence: A was trimmed (15 -> 9 shares) so A now sits at ~7.78% of wealth (4,057.92 / 52,208.94), within the 8% target; C (a downtrending name: 5-day closes [455.9, 443.58, 447.26, 445.16, 441.14]) was removed between days, showing momentum/volatility-based trimming; the portfolio holds small unrealized gains (A +1.0%) and B near cost, meaning the tightened stop-loss (~8%) and smaller position sizes are helping avoid large losses while maintaining a large cash buffer for opportunistic bids as required by the strategy.

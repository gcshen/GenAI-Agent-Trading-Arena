Weakness: I cannot evaluate the latest investment strategy because the required daily data are missing — you did not provide my financial situation (cash, total assets), the market index time series, the status/prices and bid activity for available stocks, the status of held stocks (positions, cost basis), nor realized/unrealized returns or transaction history. Without these inputs I cannot compute or cite any specific evidence from investment returns or losses (absolute or percentage P/L, contribution by position, drawdowns, win rate), so I cannot validate or critique the strategy. Strength: The challenge setup you described is well-suited to a rigorous, evidence-based evaluation: with per-iteration portfolio snapshots, price history, and realized/unrealized P/L I can produce precise, actionable conclusions — e.g., quantify return/loss per stock, identify highest/lowest contributors to performance, compute risk-adjusted metrics (Sharpe/Sortino), and give trade-level recommendations backed by the actual P/L evidence once you supply the missing data.

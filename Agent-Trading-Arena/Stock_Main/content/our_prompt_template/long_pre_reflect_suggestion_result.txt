Suggestions for a new investment strategy: [Summary evaluation of Day‑3 strategy and recommended adjustments with evidence] 1) Enforce realistic single‑stock caps relative to the available universe (move from a hard 10% to a pragmatic 12–15% temporary cap until more securities are available). Evidence: Day‑3 holdings exceed the Day‑3 10% cap — A = 19.74%, B = 19.06%, C = 10.56% of total wealth (total wealth = $59,328.87). A hard 10% cap would force large, disruptive sales (A -> ~13 shares, B -> ~12 shares) that are impractical given only three stocks in the universe. A temporary 12–15% cap reduces forced turnover while restoring diversification: at 15% target each single stock should be ~ $8,899 (A ≈ 20 shares, B ≈ 19 shares), which implies modest trims (A: sell ~6 shares; B: sell ~5 shares) rather than deep liquidation. 2) Reduce excessive cash and redeploy incrementally to improve expected returns while keeping dry powder. Evidence: cash is 43.48% of wealth on Day‑3 ($25,796.81 / $59,328.87) vs the Day‑3 strategy target of 10–15% cash. That large cash holding explains why portfolio value rose (purchases Day‑2→Day‑3 used ~$6,420 cash) but overall cash still remains uninvested. Recommendation: target 10–15% cash (≈ $5,933–$8,899) over 2–4 iterations and scale into positions in tranches (25% per iteration) as the Day‑3 scaling rule prescribes. 3) Tighten/clarify stop rules and apply them consistently to existing losers. Evidence: A and B are modest winners (A: cost $450.37 → $453.43 = +0.67%; B: cost $471.02 → $477.23 = +1.32%) while C is a small loser (cost $447.71 → $441.14 = -1.46%). Day‑3 strategy sets an 8% trailing stop for winners and a 12% hard stop on new purchases only. Recommendation: apply the 12% hard stop also to existing positions that were added within the last week or that show sustained weakness (e.g., C), and continue 8% trailing stops on A and B. This protects gains while preventing small drawdowns from becoming outsized losses. 4) Adjust rebalance trigger sensitivity to reflect observed market activity. Evidence: market index: Day‑1 +0.16%, Day‑2 -0.11%, Day‑3 -0.20% — small but persistent two‑day drift down. Day‑3 rule triggers rebalances only if the index moves >0.3% in an iteration; that threshold missed the recent small but sustained weakness that would have justified a modest defensive tilt. Recommendation: reweight the rule to trigger a 5% equity reduction if the index falls more than 0.2% in two consecutive iterations or more than 0.4% in one iteration. This would have signaled a small 5% risk reduction on Day‑3 given Day‑2→Day‑3 negative drift. 5) Rebalance math and concrete actions for next iteration(s). Evidence: portfolio value rose strongly from Day‑2 to Day‑3 ($22,365.60 → $29,282.04, +$6,916.44) because shares were added (A: 19 → 26, B: 18 → 24, C: 12 → 14) funded by cash dropping ~$6,419.58 (Day‑2 cash $32,216.39 → Day‑3 $25,796.81). Recommendation: (a) Trim A by ~6 shares and B by ~5 shares to move toward a 15% single‑stock cap; proceeds used to reduce cash from ~43% toward the 10–15% target and to build a small 4th position (if more stocks become available) or to buy more of C only if it shows a technical/base recovery. (b) If no new stocks are available, hold to a 15% cap and distribute excess cash into short‑term interest bearing instrument until new investment opportunities arise. 6) Maintain four‑tranche scaling but add a precedence rule: prioritize rebalancing to target weights before initiating new tranche purchases in a down market. Evidence: you purchased into three positions while the market drifted lower (Day‑2→Day‑3), increasing equity exposure when the Day‑3 rule would have reduced exposure on sustained down‑trends. Recommendation: in addition to 25% tranche buys, require that any new tranche purchase not increase a single holding above the interim cap (15%) and that overall equities not be increased if the index has declined in at least two of the last three iterations (instead favor redeploying to diversify or hold cash). 7) Keep dividend and income considerations explicit when trimming. Evidence: dividends per share are material (A $22, B $23, C $25). Recommendation: when trimming to meet caps, favor keeping positions with higher dividend yield adjusted for expected volatility (do not mechanically sell the highest income position without weighing yield vs outlook). 8) Reporting and rules enforcement: implement a daily allocation snapshot and enforce automatic sell rules where a position exceeds the chosen cap for two consecutive iterations. Evidence: A and B exceeded the Day‑3 10% cap across multiple days (A moved 19.74% Day‑3; B 19.06%), demonstrating execution slippage versus rule. Recommendation: automated enforcement will reduce discretionary drift. Net expected effect: these adjustments keep the spirit of Day‑3 (diversification, stops, tranche scaling) but make the single‑stock cap, cash target, and rebalance triggers achievable given the small investable universe and the recent cash/holding flows. They will also prevent buying into small sustained downtrends while reducing excessive idle cash that reduces return potential.]

New investment strategy suggestion:
Suggestions for a new investment strategy: Based on your financial situation, the market index, the status of available stocks, the status of holding stocks, and the current investment strategy, it is recommended to consider diversifying your portfolio by investing in a mix of high-performing stocks across different sectors. Additionally, it might be beneficial to monitor market trends closely and adjust your holdings accordingly to capitalize on potential opportunities. Reevaluating risk management strategies and setting stop-loss orders for certain stocks could also help mitigate losses in case of market volatility.

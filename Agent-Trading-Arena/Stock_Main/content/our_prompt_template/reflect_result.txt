New investment strategy: Maintain a diversified, sector-balanced portfolio by capping any single-stock exposure at 12% and any sector exposure at 30%, keep a 10–15% cash buffer for opportunities, size new positions inversely to short-term volatility (smaller positions for higher volatility), apply initial stop-losses of 8% and switch to a trailing stop once a position is up 5%, take profits at +15%, review every iteration but only trade when allocations deviate >5% or a stop/profit trigger occurs, and prioritize reallocations toward sectors confirmed by market-index momentum while limiting overall turnover to avoid overtrading.

New investment strategy: Limit exposure by holding no more than 12% of total portfolio value in any single stock, keep a 8–12% cash/liquidity buffer, diversify equity allocations across at least four different sectors with a 20% minimum in defensive/low-volatility positions and the remainder in market-trending/growth positions, enter positions using staggered scaling (entries at 1–3% price intervals), place initial stop-losses at ~10% and convert to a 6% trailing stop once a position is up 10–15%, set take-profit tiers at ~15% and ~30% to harvest gains, rebalance weekly or anytime the market index shifts trend by more than 3%, and reduce overall portfolio beta when volatility rises while increasing selective exposure when the index shows sustained upward momentum.
